    <h3>About Muay Thai</h3>
    <p>Muay Thai, which translates to “Thai Boxing”, is the national sport of Thailand. It is a martial art with roots originating from military use dating back to around the 13th century during the time of the Sukhothai Kingdom.
        Muay Thai is known as the “Art of 8 limbs” because it makes use of 8 points of contact namely, punches, elbows, knees and kicks. This differs it from other stand-up combat sports such as boxing (2 points - fists) and karate (4 points - fists and feet).
        Today, Muay Thai is practised and competed not only in Thailand, but also all around the world.</p>
